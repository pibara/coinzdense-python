Simple Hash Based Post Quantum Signatures : Python implementation

The C++ library [spq-sigs](https://github.com/pibara/spq-sigs) that was initially going to be backported to [pyspqsigs](https://github.com/pibara/pyspqsigs), instead is now being completely rewritten here. There is not much to see here for now. Come back later.
