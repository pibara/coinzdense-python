The coinZdense project is currently in early stages of development.
We are months away from a version that could be considered a single-threaded reference implementation.

The first type of contribution this project will be in dire need of will be a security review of the reference implementation.

Once the reference implementation has been security-reviewed and found to be secure, contributions to the Python implementation or 
any other language implementation will be more than welcomed. Anyone interested in being lead on a language implementation other than
Python or C++, please be in contact.
